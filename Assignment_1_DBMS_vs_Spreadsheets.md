Explain why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?
•	What are the advantages / disadvantages of using a DBMS (and specifically Postgres) compared to a spreadsheet (specifically MS Excel)
•	Try to have real-life correspondence.
•	Use https://atom.io/ for better performance.
•	Fill your GitHub repo accordingly.

Answer: 
Firstly, it has to be known that Database Management System and Excel Spreadsheets are totally different things. Spreadsheet is an electronic ledger or an electronic version of paper accounting worksheets. It is created to facilitate people who needed to store their accounting information in tabular form digitally. Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users’ data while considering appropriate security measures. We need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet because Database Management System pre-set the type of data contained in a certain field so that this feature prevents inadvertent mistakes. For example, if a field containing date values, the user should insert date time values in there. Otherwise, the software will show an error. Moreover, in a spreadsheet, data can be stored in a cell while in a database, data is stored in a record of a table. With DBMS,  it is almost impossible to make a mistake a record of data with a calculation. The last but not the least, spreadsheet is not very useful for creating relations between the tables. Such relations will be logically limited for spreadsheets. However, Database Management System (DBMS) can set up relations between the tables and this will boost the performance of operations and increase the speed for manipulating dataset . 

There are some advantages of DBMS (and specifically Postgres) compared to a spreadsheet (specifically MS Excel). Which are:
PostgreSQL can be used for running dynamic websites and web apps as Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP stack options.
PostgreSQL protects data integrity and build fault-tolerant environments, and help you manage your data no matter how big or small the dataset. 
 PostgreSQL source code has an open source contribution system. By means of this, it is possible to use, modify and implement freedomly as much as you want
PostgreSQL provides location-based services and geographic information systems. Therefore, it can be used for geospatial data.
Very easy to learn and use PostgreSQL. (Excel is also easy to learn, in this section it may be called equality)
Low maintenance and administration for both embedded and enterprise use of PostgreSQL.


There are some disadvantages or limitations of DBMS (and specifically Postgres) compared to a spreadsheet (specifically MS Excel). Which are:
As it is known that Postgres is an open source software and it does not belong to any organization. Therefore, it has not same advantages to compete with MS Excel (Microsoft) despite being fully featured and comparable DBMS.
Updating requires more work than Excel as PostgreSQL focuses on compatibility.
Spreadsheets are great for users with less technical experience, as most of the processing functions are automated. 
On performance metrics, it is slower than Excel Spreadsheet
In conclusion, it is clear that with appropriate security measures  DBMS are presenting more decent and useful solutions for organisations and professionals. However, Spreadsheets (MS Excel) are invaluable for anyone who need to store information to find a brief and fast solution to daily-life problems.
